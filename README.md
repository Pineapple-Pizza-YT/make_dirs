# make_dirs
A very simple program to help me creat my folder strukture fpr video making.

First of all i have to say, that this one is one of my very first real life usecase projects with python ever!

Normally i use to create a folder for a new project and copy a folder tree from another folder into it.
Now that i have started a 30 Day Video Challenge i thought about saving some time with automating the folder creation part.
Here we go. I am so in love with python and programming in general now!
